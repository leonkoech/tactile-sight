# Tacti-sight

### "Enabling vision through sound"

A tactile haptic wearable system that uses ultrasonic sensors to provide cutaneous input based on haptic object recognition and spatial object localization via vibration on the fingers of visually impaired individuals.

## Problem statement
Navigating and interacting with the physical world is a challenge for visually impaired individuals, which can limit their independence, and quality of life, cause social Isolation, and increase the risk of accidents and injuries. 

Everyday tasks like grocery shopping, traveling, and using public transportation can be difficult or impossible without assistance. Current tools, such as support canes and guide dogs, have limitations. With advances in technology, we have the potential to revolutionize the lives of visually impaired individuals by providing them with greater independence, mobility, and safety. 

And for cheap at that; introducing Tactisight, a tactile haptic system that uses ultrasonic sensors to provide cutaneous input based on haptic object recognition and spatial object localization via vibration on the fingers of visually impaired individuals.

## Why tactile feedback
Haptic Systems use sensory information derived from the afference between cuticular and kinesthetic inputs. In this project, we make use of cuticular inputs because of this reason; 
Somatosensory systems are served under two sub-systems: what deals with perceptual functions and where deals with perceptual guidance of actions.

### The "What" subsystem for Tacti-sight's haptics.
For blind individuals, the "what" subsystem would be touch processes for objects and surfaces. 

### The "Where" subsystem for Tacti-sight's haptics.
Provides a description of the layout points, surfaces, and objects in the world.

## Advantages
- Combing both passive touch and contact resulting from active exploration focuses the observer's attention to his/her subjective sensations and to the properties of the external environment respectively.
- Remote or indirect haptic perception by eliminating spatially distributed force feedback.
- Studies typically show a decline in spatial acuity in sighted individuals as compared to blind individuals who have been matched for age.
- The spatial resolving power of skin is better than ears and worse than eyes. Because blind people do not have access to the former, this system increases the spatial resolving power of the skin
- The temporal resolving power of skin is better than vision but worse than audition but we find a middle ground with ultrasonic sound as it doesn't interfere with audition while increasing the temporal resolving power of the skin.
- Haptic spatial localization refers to the coordinate system centered on the hand, constituting an egocentric frame of reference whereby the object in front of the palm of the hand would be in egocentric space.
- Geometric properties for objects beyond the fingertip scale, with defined curvature can be recognized through contour following of geometric shapesâ€”for example, tables and chairs.
