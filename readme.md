# Tacti-sight
"Enabling vision through sound"

Tactile haptic system that uses ultrasonic sensors to provide cutaneous input via vibration on fingers for blind individuals.

## Why tactile feedback
Haptic Systems use sensory information derived from the afference between cuticular and kinesthetic inputs. In this project we make use of cuticular inputs because of this reason; 
Somatosensory systems are served under two sub-systems; what - which deals with perceptual functions and where - which deals with perceptual guidance of actions.

### What subsystem for haptics.
For blind individuals, the "what" subsytem would be touch processes for object and surfaces. 

### Where subsystem for haptics.
Provides a description of the layout points, surfaces and objects in the world.

## Advantages

- Combing both passive touch and contact resulting from active exploration focus the observer's attention to his/her subjective sensations and to the properties of the external environment respectively.
- Remote or indirect haptic perception by eliminating spatially distributed force feedback.
- Studies typically shown a decline in spatial acuity in sighted individuals as compared to blind individuals who have been matched for age.
- Spatial resolving power of skin is better than ears and worse than eyes, temporal resolving power of skin is better than vision but worse than audition.
- Haptic spatial localization refers to the coordinate system centered on the hand this constituting an egocentric frame of reference whereby the object in front ot the palm of the hand would be in egocentric space.
- Geometric properties for objects beyond fingertip scale, with defined curvature can be recognized through contour following of geometric shapes. For example tables and chairs.

### Two point touch and point localization threshold on the fingertips vs other parts of the body
